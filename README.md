# SubHub
#### The right way to subscribe


## Hey You!

*Have **you** ever accidentally paid $99.99 for that free trial you **forgot** to cancel?*

*Do **you** find yourself **forgetting** all about those subscriptions to CatTube and Legends in Leagues that you 
purchased eons ago?*

Well I've got just the app for you! 

Introducing **SubHub**, the all-in-one Subscription Management application perfect for you, your business, or even 
Grandma! 

SubHub lets you:

- Keep track of your subscriptions in one place 
- View your current subscriptions
- Check when they renew
- Manage and cancel your subscriptions 

 
I made this application because I too, have overpaid for services I forgot I registered for, 
or only wanted to use for a short period of time. SubHub is here to make sure you never get charged for those 
free trials or unwanted products **ever** again.
